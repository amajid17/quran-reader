## Features

- **Tajweed coloring** — rules rendered inline using `rn-tajweed-verse` so every tajweed rule is visually marked without cluttering the text
- **RTL-first layout** — proper right-to-left rendering for Arabic text using `I18nManager`
- **Multiple Arabic fonts** — Scheherazade New, Noto Sans Arabic, and Literata Bold; user can switch between them
- **Bookmarks & reading progress** — jump back to exactly where you left off, across surahs
- **Dark / Light theme** — persistent theme preference stored locally; status bar adapts automatically
- **Data integrity check** — on launch, `verifyIntegrity()` validates all surah data against expected checksums and warns in dev mode if anything is missing or corrupted
- **Error boundary** — catches unexpected crashes gracefully and lets the user resume without losing progress
- **Fully offline** — all Quran data is bundled at build time; no network requests at runtime

## Architecture Notes

**Fonts** — Loaded at startup via `expo-font`; splash screen is held open until fonts resolve, preventing a flash of unstyled Arabic text.

**Theme** — A React context wraps the entire tree. `ThemedStatusBar` is a small dedicated component inside the provider so it can call `useTheme()` without breaking the class-based `ErrorBoundary` above it.

**Integrity check** — Runs once after fonts are ready. In development, any checksum mismatch logs which surahs failed and points to the download script. In production, this check is silent to avoid alarming users over minor data discrepancies.

**Error boundary** — If a screen crashes, the boundary catches it, logs the component stack in dev, and shows a recovery screen with a "Try again" button. Bookmarks and reading progress (stored externally in AsyncStorage) are unaffected.
